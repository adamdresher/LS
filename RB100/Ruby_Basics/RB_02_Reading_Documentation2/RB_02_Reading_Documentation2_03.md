## Optional Arguments
#### Assume you have the following code:
```ruby
s = 'abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz'
puts s.split.inspect
puts s.split(',').inspect
puts s.split(',', 2).inspect
```
What will each of the 3 `puts` statements print?
___
#### Solution
```ruby
puts s.split.inspect
["abc", "def", "ghi,jkl", "mno", "pqr,stu", "vwx", "yz"]
=> nil
```
```ruby
puts s.split(',').inspect
["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr", "stu vwx yz"]
=> nil
```
```ruby
puts s.split(',', 2).inspect
["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz"]
=> nil
```

#### Solution, LS
```ruby
# puts s.split.inspect
["abc", "def", "ghi,jkl", "mno", "pqr,stu", "vwx", "yz"]

# puts s.split(',').inspect
["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr", "stu vwx yz"]

# puts s.split(',', 2).inspect
["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz"]
```
#### Discussion
The documentation for `String#split` shows that its signature is:
```ruby
split(pattern=nil, [limit]) → anArray
```
This signature shows two different ways that the ruby documentation shows optional arguments; the first form `(pattern=nil)` is used when an optional argument has a default value, while the `[]` in `[limit]` tells us that this is an optional argument with no default value. You will sometimes see square brackets around optional arguments that have default values; we'll see this in another exercise later on.

From this, we can tell that calling `#split` without arguments is equivalent to calling it with one argument, `s.split(nil)`, which causes `#split` (per the text below the signature) to use a strange global variable named `$;`. We won't discuss this variable right now, but it will almost always be `nil`; this is the default. When `$;` is `nil`, `#split` splits the `String` based on white space. So, our first call to `#split` returns an Array of 7 elements after splitting `s` at each sequence of spaces.

The documentation also tells us that we can supply an explicit value on which to split the `String` by passing that value as the first argument. This value can be a `String` or a `Regexp`; we opt to pass in a String `','` which causes `s` to be split on commas. We thus get an Array of 3 Strings in the second `puts`.

Finally, the documentation tells us that we can specify a limit as the 2nd argument; the limit restricts the split operation so that no more than `limit` values are returned; any other delimiters will be ignored. So, our 3rd call returns a 2 element Array.

We can tell that `#split` returns `Arrays` by looking at the signature; it shows that the return value is `anArray`, which is just another way to say that an `Array` is created and returned by the method.

It's difficult to tell from the text, but the fact that `#split` returns the results of a split operation as an `Array` suggests that it does not alter the original `String`. This is, in fact, the case; `#split` does not mutate the `String` to which it is applied. This can be tested in irb if you are uncertain:
```ruby
>> s = 'abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz'
=> "abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz"
>> puts s.split.inspect
["abc", "def", "ghi,jkl", "mno", "pqr,stu", "vwx", "yz"]
=> nil
>> puts s
"abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz"
=> nil
```
