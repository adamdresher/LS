Write a program called name.rb that asks the user to type in their name and then prints out a greeting message with their name included.

##### MY SOLUTION
Solution is in name.rb

```
puts "Hi! We've never met before, my name is Computer.  What's your name? "
name = gets.chomp

puts "Ah cool!  It's nice to meet you '#{name}'."
puts "Well, that's all I needed from ya.  Gotta jam, ciao!"
```
