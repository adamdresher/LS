What do the following expressions evaluate to?

```
1. x = 2

2. puts x = 2

3. p name = "Joe"

4. four = "four"

5. print something = "nothing"
```

##### MY SOLUTIONS
1. This returns 2 as an integer.
```x``` is now a variable holding an integer value, 2.
No method is invoked to output a display.

2. This returns ```nil```.  ```puts``` doesn't return.
```x``` is now a variable holding an integer value, 2.
It outputs 2 as an integer.

3. This returns and outputs a string value, "Joe".
```name``` is now a variable holding a string value, "Joe".
Because p is used, the entire argument including quotations is output.

4. This returns "four" as a string value.
```four``` is now a variable holding a string value of "Joe".
No method is invoked to output a display.

5. This returns ```nil```.  print doesn't return.
```something``` is now a variable holding a string value, "nothing".
Because ```print``` is used, the quotations are removed and the return value is given inline.
