What is the value of a, b, and c in the following program?
```
string = "Welcome to America!"
a = string[6]
b = string[11]
c = string[19]
```

##### MY SOLUTION
```a = "e"``` 

```b = "A"```
White spaces are also string characters.

```c = nil```
```nil``` is returned because ```string``` is a valid variable assignment, but does not have the given index.
