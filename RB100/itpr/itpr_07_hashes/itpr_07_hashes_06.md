Given the following code...

```
x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}
```
What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

##### MY SOLUTION
```my_hash``` sets the key to a symbol.  It is using new syntax for defining the key-value pair.
```my_hash2``` sets the key to a variable which sets the key to a string.
