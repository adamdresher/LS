What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

##### MY SOLUTION
Exception handling is a way to manage exceptions (or errors), in a program in order to prevent said program from exiting (or breaking).  Exception handling uses the syntax `begin`, `rescue`, `end` and functions with an 'if/then' logic.  If the expression defined in `begin` throws an exception, then use `rescue`'s expression.
Aside from preventing a program from exiting, exception handling also seems useful for logging exceptions.  This might be useful for debugging or simply tracking how a program is handling its tasks.
