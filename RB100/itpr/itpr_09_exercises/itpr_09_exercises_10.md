Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)

##### MY SOLUTION
A hash value can be an array and an array can have hash elements.
> Ex. of an array as a hash value.
```
my_hash = {
  breakfast: ["oatmeal", "fruit", "tea"],
  lunch: ["the kitchen sink", "tabasco sauce"],
  dinner: "pizza"
  }
```

> Ex., of a hash within an array.
`my_arr = [my_hash]`
