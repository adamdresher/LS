### Pseudo-Code
Pseudo-code is another way of stating an algorithm.  It explains how a program works, step by step, without being limited to a program's syntax.

- Think of it as '*loading the problem into our brain first*'.  It helps us to understand the logic well.

Here's an example of pseudo-code:
```
Given a collection of integers.

Iterate through the collection one by one.
  - save the first value as the starting value.
  - for each iteration, compare the saved value with the current value.
  - if the saved value is greater, or it's the same
    - move to the next value in the collection
  - otherwise, if the current value is greater
    - reassign the saved value as the current value

After iterating through the collection, return the saved value.
```

- Trying to understand a problem while also writing in a programming language is no easy task.  Oftentimes doing both at the same time can be a recipe for confusion or *'hack and slash'* coding.  So it's best to separate these tasks.

  - **First** is to understand the problem's logic, aka create an algorithm.
  - **Second** is to adapt the algorithm to the programming language's syntax required to please the compiler/interpreter.

Therefore there are two layers to solving any problem:

1. The logical problem domain layer.
2. The syntactical programming language layer.

#### Formal Pseudo-Code:

- The problem with pseudo-code is that we cannot verify it's logic.  It must be translated into the programming code first.

- To assist in verifying logic, keywords with defined meaning can be used to create a '*formal pseudo-code*'.

#### Here's what the keywords can look like:

| keyword				| meaning								|
| --------------------  | ----------------------------------- |
| START				| start of the program					|
| SET					| sets a variable we can use for later	|
| GET					| retrieve input from user				|
| PRINT 				| displays output to user				|
| READ 					| retrieve value from variable			|
| IF / ELSE IF / ELSE	| show conditional branches in logic	|
| WHILE				| show looping logic					|
| END					| end of the program					|

And here's an example of formal pseudo-code:
```
START

Given a collection of integers called "numbers"

SET iterator = 1
SET saved_number = value within numbers collection at space 1

WHILE iterator <= length of numbers
  SET current_number = value within numbers collection at space "iterator"
  IF saved_number >= current_number
    go to the next iteration
  ELSE
    saved_number = current_number

  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT saved_number

END
```

- This allows one to think in a more detailed and structured manner.  However the same problem exists, the logic is unverified.  It must be translated to a programming language's syntax.
```ruby
def find_greatest(numbers)
  saved_number = numbers[0]

  numbers.each do |num|
    if saved_number >= num
      next
    else
      saved_number = num
    end
  end

  saved_number
end
```

- Now that the general logic has been verified, we can improve the code.  For instance, we can have a guard clause to check if `numbers = nil` or if `saved_numbers = nil` on each iteration.
- This process is simple and straightforward because the problem is simple.  With more complex problems, the translation from pseudo-code to formal pseudo-code to code may require back peddling and making changes.  This might mean starting over, repeatedly.  Verifying the code is always the final and most important step.
- More sophisticated problems will require a piecemeal approach.  This means applying pseudo-code and translating it to code, then moving on to another piece of the problem.
