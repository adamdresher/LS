### Looping
`do/while` loops are `loop/do` loops, though the naming is a little misleading.

- In a `do/while` block the conditional is given at the beginning of the block.  This means there isn't a guarantee that the block will be evaluated.
- A `loop/do` block has a great deal more flexibility.

For example:
```ruby
rick = ['drunk', 'annoyed', 'busy'].sample
loop
  puts "Wubba lubba dub dub!"
  break unless rick == 'drunk'
end
```

- Looping with strings and arrays is fairly straightforward.
- Looping with a hash requires a couple extra steps.  Since a hash doesn't have indexing, it must be created.
    - First, a counter variable is created.
    - Second, an array of keys is created.
      - A key can be retrieved by calling on its index in the array.
    - Third, a key's value is retrieved by calling on the key.

For example:
```ruby
number_of_pets = {
  'dogs' => 2,
  'cats' => 4,
  'fish' => 1
}
pets = number_of_pets.keys # => ['dogs', 'cats', 'fish']
counter = 0

loop do
  break if counter == number_of_pets.size
  current_pet = pets[counter]
  current_pet_number = number_of_pets[current_pet]
  puts "I have #{current_pet_number} #{current_pet}!"
  counter += 1
end
```

- The take away is that that there are four parts to a loop:
  - A loop
  - A counter
  - A way to retrieve the current value
  - A way to exit the loop
