### Introduction to PEDAC
PEDAC is one of many approaches to solving programming problems.  The goal of this approach is to identify and avoid pitfalls that may be encountered when coding without intent.

P - [Understanding the] **P**roblem

E - **E**xamples/Test cases

D - **D**ata Structure

A - **A**lgorithm

C - **C**ode

This assignment is going to focus on understanding the problem, data structures, and determining an algorithm.

#### P - [Understanding the] **P**roblem
There are 3 parts to understanding a problem:

    - Read the problem description.
    - Check the test cases, if any.
    - If any part of the problem is unclear, ask the interviewer or problem requester to clarify the matter.

For example:
```ruby
# PROBLEM:

# Given a string, write a method change_me which returns the same
# string but with all the words in it that are palindromes uppercased.

# change_me("We will meet at noon") == "We will meet at NOON"
# change_me("No palindromes here") == "No palindromes here"
# change_me("") == ""
# change_me("I LOVE my mom and dad equally") == "I LOVE my MOM and DAD equally"
```

Here's some questions that should be considered:

1. **What is a palindrome?**
You might ask the interviewer to tell you what a palindrome is, and the interviewer would tell you that it is a word that reads the same forwards and backward.

2. **Should the words in the string remain the same if they already use uppercase?**
Here, you can check the test cases. In the fourth test case, the word LOVE already uses uppercase, and it remains uppercase in the solution.

3. **How should I deal with empty strings provided as input?**
The test cases frequently answer this question. In this case, test case number 3 provides the answer. This is an implicit requirement that we can infer from the test cases.

4. **Can I assume that all inputs are strings?**
Test cases don't show any non-string inputs, so you should ask whether the inputs can contain non-string values, and what you should do with them. In this problem, we won't worry about non-string values.

5. **Should I consider letter case when deciding whether a word is a palindrome?**
Again, test cases don't show any appropriate examples. The interviewer might tell you that the palindrome words should be case sensitive: 'mom' is a palindrome, 'Mom' is not.

6. **Do I need to return the same string object or an entirely new string?**
This question is one of the most important and most overlooked that you can ask. Typically, while solving problems, students make certain assumptions. One assumption might be that they need to return the same string object. Students often start solving the problem without checking whether the assumption is correct. For this reason, the student might end up losing 10-15 minutes struggling with the wrong problem. In this problem, you should return an entirely new string.

7. **Always verify your assumptions either by looking at the test cases or by asking the interviewer.**
Some assumptions, like whether we should treat strings as case-sensitive or not, can be verified either by looking at the problem description, if that is mentioned there, or by checking the test cases. If you can't determine the answer with the test cases or problem description, you should ask the interviewer to clarify this for you.

Here's what the results of the clarification might look like:
```ruby
# input: string
# output: string (not the same object)
# rules:
#      Explicit requirements:
#        - every palindrome in the string must be converted to
#          uppercase. (Reminder: a palindrome is a word that reads
#          the same forwards and backward).
#        - Palindromes are case sensitive ("Dad" is not a palindrome, but "dad" is.)

#      Implicit requirements:
#        - the returned string shouldn't be the same string object.
#        - if the string is an empty string, the result should be an empty
#          string
```

#### D - **D**ata Structure / A - **A**lgorithm
These two are often paired because data structures influence the algorithm.

```ruby
# PROBLEM:

# Given a string, write a method `palindrome_substrings` which returns
# all the substrings from a given string which are palindromes. Consider
# palindrome words case sensitive.

# Test cases:

# palindrome_substrings("supercalifragilisticexpialidocious") == ["ili"]
# palindrome_substrings("abcddcbA") == ["bcddcb", "cddc", "dd"]
# palindrome_substrings("palindrome") == []
# palindrome_substrings("") == []
```

- **Can a substring be used for multiple palindrome returns?**
  Yes, a substring can be used in multiple returns based on the second test case.
- **Is the method case-sensitive?**
  Yes, the method is case-sensitive based on the second test case.
- **What is returned for an input without any palindromic substrings?**
  No palindromic substrings returns an empty array.
- **How are empty strings handled?**
  An empty string input returns an empty array.

Here's what the resulting information could look like:
```ruby
# input: string
# output: an array of string elements (not the same object)
# rules:
#      Explicit requirements:
#        - every palindrome in the string is assigned as a new array 
#          element. (Reminder: a palindrome is a word that reads
#          the same forwards and backward).
#        - Palindromes are case sensitive ("Dad" is not a palindrome, but "dad" is.)

#      Implicit requirements:
#        - the returned string shouldn't be the same string object.
#        - the same substring can be used for multiple valid palindromic 
#           element values.
#        - if the string has no palindromes, the result should be an empty
#          array.
#        - if the string is an empty string, the result should be an empty
#          array.
```

Next comes the algorithm:
```ruby
# Algorithm:
#  - initialize a result variable to an empty array
#  - create an array named substring_arr that contains all of the
#    substrings of the input string that are at least 2 characters long.
#  - loop through the words in the substring_arr array.
#  - if the word is a palindrome, append it to the result
#    array
#  - return the result array
```

- This would be considered a *high-level* algorithm.  There is some logic here that can be explained more explicitly.

One nested logic in specific is a bit more complicated and would be helpful to flesh out:
```ruby
#  - create an array named substring_arr that contains all of the
#    substrings of the input string that are at least 2 characters long.
```

Regardless, the algorithm can be converted to code and the afore mentioned nested logic can be extrapolated into 'helper' methods:
```ruby
def palindrome_substrings(str)
  result = []
  substrings_arr = substrings(str)
  substrings_arr.each do |substring|
    result << substring if is_palindrome?(substring)
  end
  result
end
```

- Notice `substrings()` and `is_palindrome?()`?  These 'helper' methods haven't been defined yet, but their names help us immediately understand their purposes.
- From here, we can go back to the algorithm and flesh out how the 'helper' methods function.
- When figuring out how the logic works, it can be helpful to consider some examples.  For example, what would 'halo' return?
  - `['ha', 'hal', 'halo', 'al', 'alo', 'lo']`
- Is there a pattern?
  - Yes, there seems to be an inner loop and an outer loop.
  - Once that logic is well understood, we can create a pseudo-code algorithm.

Here's how the `substrings()` method could be designed:
```ruby
# for each starting index from 0 through the next to last index position
  # for each substring length from 2 until there are no substrings of that length
    # extract the substring of the indicated length starting at the indicate index position
  # end of inner loop
# end of outer loop.
```

After understanding how the loops' logic works, we could create a more complete set of logic in pseudo-code:
```ruby
# - create an empty array called `result` that will contain all required substrings
# - create a `starting_index` variable (value `0`) for the starting index of a substring
# - start a loop that iterates over `starting_index` from `0` to the length of the string minus 2
#   - create a `num_chars` variable (value `2`) for the length of a substring
#   - start an inner loop that iterates over `num_chars` from `2` to `string.length - starting_index`
#     - extract a substring of length `num_chars` from `string` starting at `starting_index`
#     - append the extracted substring to the `result` array
#     - increment the `num_chars` variable by `1`
#   - end the inner loop
#   - increment the `starting_index` variable by `1`
# - end the outer loop
# - return the `result` array
```

This in turn could be used to create a formal pseudo-code:
```ruby
# START
#
#   /* Given a string named `string` */
#
#   SET result = []
#   SET starting_index = 0
#
#   WHILE starting_index <= length of string - 2
#     SET numChars = 2
#     WHILE numChars <= length of string - starting_index
#       SET substring = num_chars characters from string starting at index starting_index
#       append substring to result array
#       SET num_chars = num_chars + 1
#
#     SET starting_index = starting_index + 1
#
#   RETURN result
#
# END
```

- Formal pseudo-code is useful with complex logic, but it isn't always a necessary step.  Sometimes, it makes sense to go from pseudo-code straight to code.

Speaking of code, here's what `substrings()` could look like:
```ruby

def substrings(str)
  result = []
  starting_index = 0;

  while (starting_index <= str.length - 2)
    num_chars = 2
    while (num_chars <= str.length - starting_index)
      substring = str.slice(starting_index, num_chars)
      result << substring
      num_chars += 1
    end
    starting_index += 1
  end
  result
end
```

After applying the same process to `is_palindrome?()`, we would end up with pseudo-code and code like this:
```ruby
# input: a string
# output: an array of substrings
# rules: palindrome words should be case sensitive, meaning "abBA"
#        is not a palindrome

# Algorithm:
#  substrings method
#  =================
#    - create an empty array called `result` that will contain all required substrings
#    - create a `starting_index` variable (value `0`) for the starting index of a substring
#    - start a loop that iterates over `starting_index` from `0` to the length of the string minus 2
#      - create a `num_chars` variable (value `2`) for the length of a substring
#      - start an inner loop that iterates over `num_chars` from `2` to `string.length - starting_index`
#        - extract a substring of length `num_chars` from `string` starting at `starting_index`
#        - append the extracted substring to the `result` array
#        - increment the `num_chars` variable by `1`
#      - end the inner loop
#      - increment the `starting_index` variable by `1`
#    - end the outer loop
#    - return the `result` array

#  is_palindrome? method
#  =====================
# - Inside the `is_palindrome?` method, check whether the string
#   value is equal to its reversed value. You can use the
#   String#reverse method.

#  palindrome_substrings method
#  ============================
#  - initialize a result variable to an empty array
#  - create an array named substring_arr that contains all of the
#    substrings of the input string that are at least 2 characters long.
#  - loop through the words in the substring_arr array.
#  - if the word is a palindrome, append it to the result
#    array
#  - return the result array
```
```ruby
def substrings(str)
  result = []
  starting_index = 0;

  while (starting_index <= str.length - 2)
    num_chars = 2
    while (num_chars <= str.length - starting_index)
      substring = str.slice(starting_index, num_chars)
      result << substring
      num_chars += 1
    end
    starting_index += 1
  end
  result
end

def is_palindrome?(str)
  str == str.reverse
end

def palindrome_substrings(str)
  result = []
  substrings_arr = substrings(str)
  substrings_arr.each do |substring|
    result << substring if is_palindrome?(substring)
  end
  result
end

p palindrome_substrings("supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"); # ["ili"]
p palindrome_substrings("abcddcbA");   # ["bcddcb", "cddc", "dd"]
p palindrome_substrings("palindrome"); # []
p palindrome_substrings("");           # []
```

An important takeaway here is that you should always be able to write the solution in plain English.  'Fancy' methods won't save you, if you can't understand the problem and how to solve it.

#### Testing Frequently:

- Don't wait to test until after writing an entire program.  It's often easiest to fix a bug if it's found sooner.
- Testing frequently means there is less code to read and evaluate.
