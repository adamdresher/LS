### The PEDAC Problem Solving Process
- PEDAC is not a completely linear process
  - Move back and forwards between the steps
  - Switch from implementation mode to abstract problem solving mode when necessary
- Don't try to problem solve at the coding level

**Understanding the Problem**

- Establish the rules / define the boundaries of the problem
  - Assessing available information
  - Restating explicit requirements (stated in the problem)
  - Identifying implicit requirements (not stated in the problem description, but based on understanding of the problem)
- Don't rush this step.

**Examples and Test Cases**

- Can confirm / refute assumptions
- Can clarify implicit requirements / questions
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and boundaries

**Data Structures**

- Help to work with data in a logical manner
- Provide a structure to interact with data
- Thinking in terms of data structures is part of the problem solving process
- Data structures are closely linked to algorithms
  - a chosen data structure can become the backbone of an algorithm
  - associated steps/processes become available with data structures
    - steps for input to output
    - involves structuring data in a specific way

**Algorithms**

- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task / objective
  - Closely linked to data structures
- An algorithm should be written in plain English without reference to any syntax
  - Using syntax or even formal pseudo-code can lock you in to a particular direction
  - Use high-level, abstract logic
  - Don't worry about efficiency for now

**Implementing a solution in Code**

- Translating solution algorithm to code
- Think about algorithm in context of programming language
  - Language features and constraints
  - Characteristics of data structures
  - Built in functions / methods
  - Syntax and coding patterns
- Create test cases
- Code with intent
