### Selection and Transformation
With high proficiency in selection and transformation, nearly anything can be performed on a collection.

- Selection generally means collection.size or less elements.
- Transformation generally means exactly collection.size elements.

Selection and transformation require *some criteria*:

- Selection uses the criteria to determine which elements to select.
- Transformation uses the criteria to determine how the elements are transformed.

#### Looping to Select and Transform:

- A loop with selection can be as simple as adding an `if` statement to `loop`.
- A loop with transformation doesn't necessarily need an `if` statement.
  - **It's important to note whether the transformation is on a new object or the original object.**
- A loop with transformation and selection *would* require an `if` statement, or some other conditional logic.

#### Extracting to Methods:

Selection or transformation actions are usually specific by nature.  This means they lend themselves to being extracted to 'helper' methods.

An example of a method with a looping selection function:
```ruby
# Problem:
# select the key-value pairs where the value is 'Fruit'
#
# 1. convert `produce` to an array and set it to a new variable, `produce_array`
# 2. loop over the `produce_array`
# 3. read element (elements are nested arrays)
# 4. read the nested array's second element and compare with `'Fruit'`
# 5. if comparison is true, select the nested array's first element (the key)
# 6. push the key to a new array, `selected_produce`
# 7. next iteration
# 8. return `selected_produce`
#
# looping logic
# 	a. create a counter set to 0
# 	b. start loop
# 	c. read element using counter as the array's index, `produce_array[counter]`
# 	d. selection actions
# 	e. counter += 1

produce = {
  'apple' => 'Fruit',
  'carrot' => 'Vegetable',
  'pear' => 'Fruit',
  'broccoli' => 'Vegetable'
}

def select_fruit(produce)
  produce_arr = produce.to_a
  selected_produce = []
  count = 0

  while count < 4
    selected_produce << produce_arr[count] if produce_arr[count][1] == 'Fruit'
    count += 1
  end

  selected_produce.to_h
end
```

There were other examples asking for code to be created or modified regarding transformation or selection & transformation, however the example above highlights the aspect most important for me to remember/improve: *effective understanding of the problem*.

#### More Flexible Methods:

Adding additional parameters creates more flexibility in a method.

The next couple exercises asks modify a method to accept a second parameter so we can:

- specify what number to multiply the first parameter by (originally 2).
```ruby
def multiply(numbers, multi_by)
  multiplied_numbers = []
  counter = 0

  loop do
    break if counter == numbers.size

    multiplied_numbers << numbers[counter] * multi_by
    counter += 1
  end

  multiplied_numbers
end
```

- specify what letter to select from the first parameter (a string).
```ruby
def select_letter(string, letter)
  selected_letters = ''
  count = 0

  loop do
    break if count == string.length

    selected_letters << string[count] if string[count] == letter
    count += 1
  end

  selected_letters
end
```
