### Working with Blocks
When evaluating code, ask the following questions:

- What is the type of action being performed (method call, block, conditional, etc.)?
- What is the object that action is being performed on?
- What is the side-effect of that action (e.g. output or destructive action)?
- What is the return value of that action?
- Is the return value used by whatever instigated the action?

A helpful table can be made to parse through code:

#### Example 1
```ruby
[[1, 2], [3, 4]].each do |arr|
  puts arr.first
end
```
```ruby
# 1
# 3
# => [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```
`#each` is called on an array of nested arrays.  In the method's block, `arr` is used as a parameter to reference each nested array.  The block calls `#puts`, which will output the argument pasted to it.  The argument passed to it is `arr.first`, which returns the first element of each nested array.  So `#puts` will output the first element of each nested array- `1` and `3`.  Because `#each` is invoked, the block's return value is ignored and instead returns the calling array.

---
#### Example 2
```ruby
[[1, 2], [3, 4]].map do |arr|
  puts arr.first
end
```
```ruby
# 1
# 3
# => [nil, nil]
```
An array of nested arrays calls `Array#map`, which iterates over its elements and returns a new array containing its block's return values.  The method's block defines its parameter as `arr`, which is reassigned to the caller's current element at the beginning of each iteration.  The block contains one line which first evaluates `arr.first`.  `Array#first` returns the nested array's first element and passes it to `#puts`.  `#puts` outputs the argument (`1` and `3`) and returns `nil`.  Because there are two nested arrays in `#map`'s caller, `#map` returns an array of 2 `nil`.

| Line | Action | Object | Side Effect | Return Value | Is Return Value Used? |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | method call (`#map`) | an array | none | a new array | no, but shown on line 6 |
| 1-3 | block execution | each nested array | none | the last line evaluated | yes, to create elements for `#map`'s return value |
| 2 | method call (`#first`) | each nested array | none | element at index 0 of the nested array | yes, it's passed to `#puts` |
| 2 | method call (`#puts` | return value of `#first` | outputs `#first`'s return value converted to a string | `nil` | yes, as the return value of the block |

---
#### Example 3
```ruby
[[1, 2], [3, 4]].map do |arr|
  puts arr.first
  arr.first
end
```
```ruby
# 1
# 3
# => [1, 3]
```
`#map` is called on an array of nested arrays.  It takes a block which iterates over its nested arrays and uses the block's return values as elements of a new array, then returns the new array.  The block calls `#first` on each nested array and returns the number at its index 0.  This is passed to `#puts` which outputs a string representation of the number and returns `nil`.  Next, `#first` is called again on the current nested array and returns the element at index 0 again- this time the return value is used as the block's return value, thus becoming an element in `#map`'s return array.

| Line | Action | Object | Side Effect | Return Value | Is Return Value Used? |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | method call (`#map`) | an array | none | new array | no |
| 1-4 | block execution | each nested array | none | `arr.first` | yes, creates elements for `#map`'s return array |
| 2 | method call (`#first`) | each nested array | none | element at index 0 of the nested array | yes, passes to `#puts` |
| 2 | method call (`#puts`) | element at index 0 of the nested array | outputs a string representation of an integer | `nil` | no |
| 3 | method call (`#first`) | each nested array | none | element at index 0 of the nested array | yes, returns value for the block |

---
#### Example 4
```ruby
my_arr = [[18, 7], [3, 12]].each do |arr|
  arr.each do |num|
    if num > 5
      puts num
    end
  end
end
```
```ruby
# 18
# 7
# 12
# => [[18, 7], [3, 12]]
```
This example begins with variable assignment to a method call.  `#each` is called on by an array of nested arrays.  As such, the variable will be assigned `[18, 7], [3, 12]]`.  Continuing, `#each` takes a block and iterates over its nested arrays.  On each iteration, the current nested array calls `#each` which calls its own block.  This inner block iterates over the nested array's integer elements.  On each iteration of integer elements, an `if` statement is evaluated.  The current integer calls `#>` with `5` passed as an argument to determine if the current integer is greater than `5`.  If the return value is `true`, the `if` statement's block is evaluated, else the block is ignored.  If the block is evaluated, `#puts` is called and outputs a string representation of the current element number, then returns `nil` to the block.  The result is that `nil` is passed regardless of how the `if` is evaluated, which in turn is ignored by both `#each` methods.

#### Example 5
```ruby
[[1, 2], [3, 4]].map do |arr|
  arr.map do |num|
    num * 2
  end
end
```
```ruby
# => [[2, 4], [6, 8]]
```
`[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` invokes `#map`, which iterates over its nested arrays and returns a new array.  The method's block takes each nested array and passes them to a new invocation of `#map`.  Now each number within the nested array is iterated over.  Each number is passed to `Integer#*` which is given `2` as an argument.  This results in the number being multiplied by 2.  Because that is the only line in the inner block, the return value of `#*` is used as an element in the inner `#map`'s return array.  Once the inner `#map` finishes iterating through a nested array, it returns a new array to the outer `#map`'s block, which then iterates over the next nested array and processes it in kind.  Each iteration of the outer `#map`'s block starts and ends with the inner `#map` invocation (it's the only action performed), so the inner `#map`'s return arrays become elements for the outer `#map`'s return value- a new array.  The exercise ends with the outer `#map` returning its value.

|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | method call (`#map` | `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` | none | a new array | no |

| 3 | method call (`#*`) | each integer of each nested array | none | an integer | yes, passes to the block |

#### Example 6
```ruby
[{ a: 'ant', b: 'elephant' }, { c: 'cat' }].select do |hash|
  hash.all? do |key, value|
    value[0] == key.to_s
  end
end
```
```ruby
# => [{ :c => "cat" }]
```
An array of hashes is passed to `#select` which passes its caller's elements to its block and selects the elements if the block iteration returns `true`, then returns a new array with the selected elements.  In the block, each hash is passed to `#all?` which calls a block and returns a boolean based on whether every iteration of the block returns truthy.  The inner block iterates over each hash key-value pair, comparing the value's substring at index 0 to the key represented as a string.  This is equivalent to saying the inner block is checking if the key matches the value's first character.  If all key-value pairs return `true`, `#all?` will return `true`.  Because this is the only action within the outer block, this value will be passed to `#select`, which will select the current hash element.  If any key-value pair returns `false`, `#all?` will return `false` to the outer block, which will move on to the next iteration.

Let's look at why `{ a: 'ant', b: 'elephant' }` is not returned by `#select`.  First, `{ a: 'ant', b: 'elephant' }` is passed as an element to `#select`'s block and used to call `#all?`.  `#all?` passes each key and value into its block.  This inner block uses `#==` to compare two arguments.  In this case the arguments are the value's first substring (using `String#[]`) and key represented as a string (using `Symbol#to_s`).  `a: 'ant'` returns `'a' == 'a'`, which evaluates to `true`.  `b: 'elephant'` returns `'e' == 'b'`, which evaluates to `false`.  Because `b: 'elephant'` returns `'false'`, `#all?` returns `false`, which results in `#select` not selecting the hash and moving on to the next iteration.

| Line | Action | Object | Side Effect | Return Value | Is Return Value Used? |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | method call (`#select`) | `[{ a: 'ant', b: 'elephant' }, { c: 'cat' }]` | none | a new array | no |
| 1-5 | block execution | each hash element | none | boolean | yes, passes to `#select` to define element selection |
| 2 | method call (`#all?`) | each hash element | none | boolean | yes, passes to block |
| 2-4 | block execution | each key-value pair | none | boolean | yes, passes to `#all?` |
| 3 | method call (`String#[]`) | each value | none | substring | yes, becomes the caller for `#==` |
| 3 | method call (`Symbol#to_s`) | each key | none | substring | yes, becomes the argument for `#==` |
| 3 | comparison (`#==`) | substring of each value | none | boolean | yes, passes to `#all?` |

#### Example 7
Sorting nested arrays can be a bit tricky given that there are multiple levels to consider.  It's often helpful to remember that there are two sets of comparison occurring:

- Each of the inner arrays is compared with the other inner arrays.
- The way those arrays are compared is by comparing the elements within them.
```ruby
arr = [['1', '8', '11'], ['2', '6', '13'], ['2', '12', '15'], ['1', '8', '9']]
arr.sort
```
```ruby
# => [["1", "8", "11"], ["1", "8", "9"], ["2", "12", "15"], ["2", "6", "13"]]
```
String comparison functions differently than numerical comparison.  For String objects, each pair of substring characters are compared.  Their order in the ASCII table is used for comparison.  If they are the same, the next iteration occurs.  If they are unequal, the character with the lower order number receives precedence in sorting.  For String numbers, this means `11` has a higher precedence than `2` (in other words, `11` begins before `2`).

In order to achieve *numerical* comparison, `#sort` or `#sort_by` requires a block with transformation prior to comparison.
```ruby
arr.sort_by do |sub_arr|
  sub_arr.map do |num|
    num.to_i
  end
end
```
```ruby
# => [["1", "8", "9"], ["1", "8", "11"], ["2", "6", "13"], ["2", "12", "15"]]
```
Here, `#sort_by`'s block is iterating through each nested array which then calls `#map` to transform and return new arrays for comparison.  The new arrays are based on `#map`'s return block which iterates through each String number in the nested arrays and calls `#to_i` on them to transform them into Integer objects.  This results in new nested arrays of Integer objects which can be compared *numerically* instead of via String's ASCII comparison.  None of the methods mutate their callers and there are no side effects.

---
#### Example 8
```ruby
[[8, 13, 27], ['apple', 'banana', 'cantaloupe']].map do |arr|
  arr.select do |item|
    if item.to_s.to_i == item    # if it's an integer
      item > 13
    else
      item.size < 6
    end
  end
end
```
```ruby
# => [[27], ["apple"]]
```
The trick here is in selecting the objects within the nested arrays.  Because the desired objects are in nested arrays, using `#select` straight away isn't going to work.  `#select` would be working with the nested arrays rather than the nested arrays' elements (which are the objects we are focused on).
Instead,  `#map` works ideally here because it gives the ability to work with each nested array and return a modified version.  When `#select` is chained, there is now an ability to select which objects within the nested array are desired, then pass them to `#map` which will create new arrays based on that selection.
All that's left now was to create an conditional statement to select the desired object.

This example highlights the importance of remembering what level within a nested collection you are working on.

---
#### Example 9
```ruby
[[[1], [2], [3], [4]], [['a'], ['b'], ['c']]].map do |element1|
  element1.each do |element2|
    element2.partition do |element3|
      element3.size > 0
    end
  end
end
```
```ruby
# => [[[1], [2], [3], [4]], [["a"], ["b"], ["c"]]]
```
In this example, the calling object is a three level nested array.  It calls on `#map` which iterates over each second, or middle, level array.  Because `#map` was called, a new array object will be returned using its block's return values as elements.  In `#map`'s block, each middle level array calls `#each` which also takes a block to iterate over each middle level arrays' element (third, or bottom, level arrays).  The return value of `#each`'s block will be ignored and `#each` will return its caller.  Still it is important to continue evaluating this example, as any mutating methods or side effects can also effect the return values.  Continuing, in `#each`'s block, the each bottom level array calls on `#partition` to iterate over their own elements.  At this point, the elements are now Integer or String objects.  `#partition` returns an array of two nested arrays where each nested array contains either `true` elements or `false` elements.  In `#partition`'s block, each bottom level Integer or String element is passed to `#size` which returns the number of digits or characters in the calling object.  This number is passed to `#>` which compares the number to `0` and returns a boolean.  The boolean is passed to `#partition` to determine which of its arrays to add it to.  However this return value will be ignored because `#partition`'s return value is passed to `#each`.

#### Example 10
```ruby
[[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [5, 6]].map do |arr|
  arr.map do |el|
    if el.to_s.size == 1    # it's an integer
      el + 1
    else                    # it's an array
      el.map do |n|
        n + 1
      end
    end
  end
end
```
```ruby
# => [[[2, 3], [4, 5]], [6, 7]]
```
This example begins by using a three level nested array to call `#map`, iterate over its elements, and return a new array.  The elements are two second, or middle, level arrays- one is a nested array (`[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`) and the other is a normal array (`[5, 6]`).  On each iteration of the top level `#map`'s block, `#map` is called again.  This second, or middle, level `#map` is iterating over third, or bottom, level arrays (`[1, 2]`, `[3, 4]`) and Integers `5`, `6`.  In the middle `#map`'s block, the elements are passed to an `if` statement.  First, the element is returned as a string representation using `#to_s`, then the number of digits or characters are returned using `#size`.  This number is passed to `#==` which compares it to `1`.  If the comparison condition is `true`, the element is passed to `#+` with `1` as an argument.  This results in Integer elements being incremented by 1 and returned to the `if` statement.  If `#==` returns `false`, the `else` statement is evaluated.  The `else` statement tells the current element to call `#map`.  This third, or bottom, level `#map`'s block iterates over the third, or bottom, level arrays' Integers.  In the block, the Integer calls `#+` with `1` as an argument.  This results in each Integer element incrementing by `1` and returning a new array to the bottom `#map` which is in turn returned to the `if` statement which passes it to the middle `#map`'s block.  The overall result is a new array returned with the same structure but every Integer incremented by `1`.

#### Mutating Collections While Iterating
*Do not mutate the collection that you're iterating through.*

Even for methods that are intended to mutate, mutating the caller can cause unexpected consequences during iteration.  This is because the caller is updated at every iteration.  So adding, removing, or mutating the caller's elements in it's block can cause elements to be skipped, ignored, or mutated in unintended ways due to transformation.
```ruby
# The method remove_evens! should delete all even numbers from the array passed in as the argument.

def remove_evens!(arr)
  arr.each do |num|
    if num % 2 == 0
      arr.delete(num)
    end
  end
  arr
end

p remove_evens!([1,1,2,3,4,6,8,9])
# expected return value [1, 1, 3, 9]
# actual return value [1, 1, 3, 6, 9]
```
A simple solution is to create a shallow copy.
```ruby
def remove_evens!(arr)
  cloned_arr = arr.dup
  cloned_arr.each do |num|
    if num % 2 == 0
      arr.delete(num)
    end
  end
  arr
end
```

#### Summary
- If at first code appears opaque or complex, take the time to break it down step by step.
- If necessary use some sort of systematic approach (such as the tabular method outlined in this assignment).
- Figure out what is happening at each step, paying particular attention to:
  - Return values.
  - Side effects.
- Pay attention to the return values of all statements in your code, especially where implicit return values are being relied on.
- Make sure you have a clear understanding of the underlying concepts such as data structure, loops, iterative methods and the blocks passed to them.
- Be clear about the method implementation of the iterative method(s) being used, especially:
  - What values are passed to the block.
  - What the method does with the return block.
