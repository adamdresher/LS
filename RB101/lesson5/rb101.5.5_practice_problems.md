### Practice Problems: Sorting, Nested Collections, & Working with Blocks
Practice makes perfect. =)
Solve these problems without using Ruby specific methods to achieve solutions.  Use the concepts and techniques learned in this lesson to develop a strong foundation in working with collections.

---
#### Practice Problem 1
How would you order this array of number strings by descending numeric value?
```ruby
arr = ['10', '11', '9', '7', '8']
```
```ruby
arr.sort_by { |a, b| b <=> a }
# => ["10", "11", "9", "7", "8"]
```

---
#### Practice Problem 2
How would you order this array of hashes based on the year of publication of each book, from the earliest to the latest?
```ruby
books = [
  {title: 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', author: 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez', published: '1967'},
  {title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', published: '1925'},
  {title: 'War and Peace', author: 'Leo Tolstoy', published: '1869'},
  {title: 'Ulysses', author: 'James Joyce', published: '1922'}
]
```
```ruby
books.sort_by { |hash| hash[:published] }
# => 
# [{:title=>"War and Peace", :author=>"Leo Tolstoy", :published=>"1869"},
#  {:title=>"Ulysses", :author=>"James Joyce", :published=>"1922"},
#  {:title=>"The Great Gatsby", :author=>"F. Scott Fitzgerald", :published=>"1925"},
#  {:title=>"One Hundred Years of Solitude", :author=>"Gabriel Garcia Marquez", :published=>"1967"}]
```

---
#### Practice Problem 3
For each of these collection objects demonstrate how you would reference the letter `'g'`.
```ruby
arr1 = ['a', 'b', ['c', ['d', 'e', 'f', 'g']]]

arr2 = [{first: ['a', 'b', 'c'], second: ['d', 'e', 'f']}, {third: ['g', 'h', 'i']}]

arr3 = [['abc'], ['def'], {third: ['ghi']}]

hsh1 = {'a' => ['d', 'e'], 'b' => ['f', 'g'], 'c' => ['h', 'i']}

hsh2 = {first: {'d' => 3}, second: {'e' => 2, 'f' => 1}, third: {'g' => 0}}
```
```ruby
arr1[2][1][3]
# => 'g'
arr2[1][:third][0]
# => 'g'
arr3[2][:third][0][0]
# => 'g'
hsh1['b'][1]
# => 'g'
hsh2[:third].key(0)
# => 'g'
```

---
#### Practice Problem 4
For each of these collection objects where the value `3` occurs, demonstrate how you would change this to `4`.
```ruby
arr1 = [1, [2, 3], 4]

arr2 = [{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: [7, 6, 5], d: 4}, 3]

hsh1 = {first: [1, 2, [3]]}

hsh2 = {['a'] => {a: ['1', :two, 3], b: 4}, 'b' => 5}
```
```ruby
arr1[1][1] = 4 # => 4
arr1 # => [1, [2, 4], 4]
arr2[2] = 4 # => 4
arr2 # => [{:a=>1}, {:b=>2, :c=>[7, 6, 5], :d=>4}, 4]
hsh1[:first][2][0] = 4 # => 4
hsh1 # => {:first=>[1, 2, [4]]}
hsh2[['a']][:a][2] = 4 # => 4
hsh2 # => {["a"]=>{:a=>["1", :two, 4], :b=>4}, "b"=>5}
```

---
#### Practice Problem 5
Given this nested Hash, figure out the total age of just the male members of the family:
```ruby
munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}
```
```ruby
males_total_age = []
munsters.each_value do |personal_info|
  males_total_age << personal_info['age'] if personal_info['gender'] == 'male'
end
males_total_age.sum # => 444
```
**Algorithm:**

- initialize an empty array, `males_total_age`
- iterate through `munsters`:
  - select all keys which contain the key-value pair, 'gender'=>'male'
  - iterate through selected keys:
    - return the value for the key, 'age'
      - pass the value to `males_total_age`
- sum the elements in `males_total_age`
- return the value from sum

---
#### Practice Problem 6
One of the most frequently used real-world string properties is that of "string substitution", where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with various parameters from our program.

Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name, age and gender of each family member like this:
```ruby
(Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).
```
```ruby
munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}
munsters.each_pair do |k, v|
  puts "#{k} is a #{v['age']}-year-old #{v['gender']}."
end
```
**Explicit:**

- Input: A hash.
- Output: A multiline string.
- Each line of string contains values from each nested hash.
- Each line uses the nested hash the values: `'name'`, `'age'`, and `'gender"`

**Implicit:**

- What is the format for the output string?
    - `"#{munsters[key]} is a #{munsters[key]['age']}-year-old #{munsters[key]['gender']}."`

**Algorithm:**

- iterate through hash:
  - output a string:
  - `"#{munsters[key]} is a #{munsters[key]['age']}-year-old #{munsters[key]['gender']}.'`

---
#### Practice Problem 7
Given this code, what would be the final values of `a` and `b`? Try to work this out without running the code.
```ruby
a = 2
b = [5, 8]
arr = [a, b]
```
```ruby
arr[0] += 2
arr[1][0] -= a
arr # => [4, [3, 8]]
a # => 2
b # => [3, 8]
```
`arr[0] += 2` is equivalent to `arr[0] = arr[0] + 2`.  This means the first element of `arr` is being reassigned, while `a` is still referencing `2`.

`arr[1][0] -= a` is equivalent to `arr[1][0] = arr[1][0] - a`.  This is also reassignment, however `b` is an array and responds differently to reassignment.  Since we are reassigning an element within `b`, `b` is being modified.  And because `arr` is referencing `b`, they both reflect this reassignment.

---
#### Practice Problem 8
Using the `each` method, write some code to output all of the vowels from the strings.
```ruby
hsh = {first: ['the', 'quick'], second: ['brown', 'fox'], third: ['jumped'], fourth: ['over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']}
```
```ruby
VOWELS = %w(a e i o u)

hsh.each_value do |arr|
  arr.each do |word|
    word.each_char do |letter|
      puts letter if VOWELS.include?(letter.downcase)
    end
  end
end
# e
# u
# i
# o
# o
# u
# e
# o
# e
# e
# a
# o
# => 
# {:first=>["the", "quick"],
#  :second=>["brown", "fox"],
#  :third=>["jumped"],
#  :fourth=>["over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]}
```
**Explicit:**

- Input: A hash.
- Output: A multiline string.
- The output contains only vowels.

**Implicit:**

- Where are the string vowels located?
    - The output is using the hash's values' elements.

**Algorithm:**

- initialize a constant variable set to string vowels
- iterate through the hash's values:
  - iterate through each array value:
    - iterate through each string element:
      - downcase the character element
      - output character element if it matches the constant

---
#### Practice Problem 9
Given this data structure, return a new array of the same structure but with the sub arrays being ordered (alphabetically or numerically as appropriate) in descending order.
```ruby
arr = [['b', 'c', 'a'], [2, 1, 3], ['blue', 'black', 'green']]
```
```ruby
arr.map { |sub_arr| sub_arr.sort { |a, b| b <=> a }}
# => [["c", "b", "a"], [3, 2, 1], ["green", "blue", "black"]]
```
**Explicit:**

- Input: An array.
- Return: A new array.
- Return array is sorted.
- Sorting is alphabetical or numerical, in decending order.

**Implicit:**

- How are alphabetical or numerical order chosen?
    - Alphabetical or numerical is based on the object class.

**Algorithm:**

- iterate over input array's arrays and return a new array:
  - sort based on `'b' <=> 'a'

---
#### Practice Problem 10
Given the following data structure and without modifying the original array, use the `map` method to return a new array identical in structure to the original but where the value of each integer is incremented by 1.
```ruby
[{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: 3}, {d: 4, e: 5, f: 6}]
```
```ruby
[{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: 3}, {d: 4, e: 5, f: 6}].map do |hash|
  hash.each_key { |k| hash[k] += 1 }
end
# => [{:a=>2}, {:b=>3, :c=>4}, {:d=>5, :e=>6, :f=>7}]
```
**Explicit:**
- Input: An array.
- Return: A new array.
- Return array has the same structure as input array.
- Nested hash values which are Integers are incremented by 1.

**Implicit:**

- How are values of nested hashes which are not Integers handled?
    - All values are Integers.

**Algorithm:**

- iterate over array and return a new array:
  - iterate over hash elements' keys and return self:
    - `hash[key] += 1`

---
#### Practice Problem 11
Given the following data structure use a combination of methods, including either the `select` or `reject` method, to return a new array identical in structure to the original but containing only the integers that are multiples of `3`.
```ruby
arr = [[2], [3, 5, 7], [9], [11, 13, 15]]
```
```ruby
arr.map { |arr| arr.select { |i| i % 3 == 0 }}
# => [[], [3], [9], [15]]

# Solution 2.
arr.map { |arr| arr.reject { |i| i % 3 != 0 }}
# => [[], [3], [9], [15]]
```
**Explicit:**

- Input: An array.
- Return: A new array.
- Return array has the same structure as input array.
- Return array's nested arrays only contain elements which are multiples of `3`.

**Implicit:**

- Are there any elements that are non-numbers?
    - No.  All elements are Integers.
- How are arrays handled that have no multiples of `3`?
    - Returns empty arrays.

**Algorithm:**

- iterate through input array's arrays and return a new array:
  - iterate through nested arrays and return selected elements:
    - select element if it is a multiple of 3

Solution 2.

- iterate through input array's arrays and return a new array:
  - iterate through nested arrays and return selected elements:
    - remove element if it is not a multiple of 3

---
#### Practice Problem 12
Given the following data structure, and **without** using the `Array#to_h` method, write some code that will return a hash where the key is the first item in each sub array and the value is the second item.
```ruby
arr = [[:a, 1], ['b', 'two'], ['sea', {c: 3}], [{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4}, 'D']]
# expected return value: {:a=>1, "b"=>"two", "sea"=>{:c=>3}, {:a=>1, :b=>2, :c=>3, :d=>4}=>"D"}
```
```ruby
arr.each_with_object({}) { |sub_arr, hash| hash[sub_arr[0]] = sub_arr[1] }
# => {:a=>1, "b"=>"two", "sea"=>{:c=>3}, {:a=>1, :b=>2, :c=>3, :d=>4}=>"D"}

# Solution 2.
hash = {}
arr.each { |sub_arr| hash[sub_arr[0]] = sub_arr[1] }

hash
# => {:a=>1, "b"=>"two", "sea"=>{:c=>3}, {:a=>1, :b=>2, :c=>3, :d=>4}=>"D"}
```
**Explicit:**

- Input: An array.
- Return: A hash.
- Input array contains nested 2-element arrays.
  - The elements are symbols, strings, and hashes.
- Return hash keys are input's nested array's 1st element.
- Return hash values are input's nested array's 2nd element.

**Implicit:**

- How is an empty sub-array in input array handled?
    - The given array doesn't contain this edge case.
- How is a sub-array with only 1 element in input array handled?
    - The given array doesn't contain this edge case.
- How is a sub-array with only 1 element in input array handled?
    - The given array doesn't contain this edge case.

**Algorithm:**

- initialize an empty hash and set it to a variable:
  - `hash`
- iterate through `arr`'s elements:
  - `hash[element[0]] = element[1]`
- return `hash`

---
#### Practice Problem 13
Given the following data structure, return a new array containing the same sub-arrays as the original but ordered logically by only taking into consideration the odd numbers they contain.
```ruby
arr = [[1, 6, 9], [6, 1, 7], [1, 8, 3], [1, 5, 9]]
# ???
# => [[1, 8, 3], [1, 5, 9], [6, 1, 7], [1, 6, 9]]

# this allows the sub-arr to be sorted by their 1st element (only odd num),
# then removes 1st element from each sub-arr
sorting_arr = arr.map do |sub_arr|
                new_sub_arr = sub_arr.select { |i| i.odd? }
                [new_sub_arr, sub_arr]
              end
# => [[[1, 9], [1, 6, 9]], [[1, 7], [6, 1, 7]], [[1, 3], [1, 8, 3]], [[1, 5, 9], [1, 5, 9]]]
sorting_arr.sort_by { |a, b| a[0] <=> b[0] }.map { |sub_arr| sub_arr.pop }

#### Practice Problem 14
Given this data structure write some code to return an array containing the colors of the fruits and the sizes of the vegetables. The sizes should be uppercase and the colors should be capitalized.
```ruby
hsh = {
  'grape' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['red', 'green'], size: 'small'},
  'carrot' => {type: 'vegetable', colors: ['orange'], size: 'medium'},
  'apple' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['red', 'green'], size: 'medium'},
  'apricot' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['orange'], size: 'medium'},
  'marrow' => {type: 'vegetable', colors: ['green'], size: 'large'},

           food[:colors].map { |word| word.capitalize }
         else
           food[:size].upcase
         end
end
# => [["Red", "Green"], "MEDIUM", ["Red", "Green"], ["Orange"], "LARGE"]

# Solution 2.
hsh.inject([]) do |result, hsh|
  food = hsh.to_a[1]
  result << if food[:type] == 'fruit'
              food[:colors].map { |word| word.capitalize }
            else
              food[:size].upcase
            end
end
# => [["Red", "Green"], "MEDIUM", ["Red", "Green"], ["Orange"], "LARGE"]
```
**Explicit:**

- Input: A hash.
- Return: An array.
- Return array contains the colors of fruits and sizes of vegetables.
- Sizes should be upppercase strings.
- Colors should be capitalized.

**Implicit:**

- Are there any other foods beside `'fruit'` and `'vegetable'`?

    - set 2-element array to a variable:
      - `food`
  - if food[:type] == 'fruit'
    - iterate through array and return new array:
      - capitalize all string elements
  - else
    - upcase the food[:size]

---
#### Practice Problem 15
Given this data structure write some code to return an array which contains only the hashes where all the integers are even.
```ruby
arr = [{a: [1, 2, 3]}, {b: [2, 4, 6], c: [3, 6], d: [4]}, {e: [8], f: [6, 10]}]

arr.select { |hsh| hsh.values.all? { |nums| nums.all? { |i| i.even? }}}
# => [{:e=>[8], :f=>[6, 10]}]
```
**Explicit:**

- Input: An array.
- Return: A new array.
- Return array contains only hashes with values that only contain even integers.

**Implicit:**

- Does the input array contain any non-hash elements?
    - No.
- Do any of the input array's hash elements contain any non-number elements?
    - No.  They are all Integers.
- Should the solution mutate any of the hashes?
    - No, only select and return valid hashes.

      - true
    - else
      - false

---
#### Practice Problem 16
Write a method that returns one UUID when called with no parameters.

**Explicit:**

- Input: None.
- Return: A string.
- Return string is a set of randomized characters.
- Return string should contain 32 characters.
  - Characters are broken up into 5 sections.
  - Sections are delimited with dashes, `'-'`.

**Implicit:**

- How are the lengths of each character section determined?
    - UUID has a standardized format.
    - The length of each section is: 8-4-4-4-12
    - With dashes, this results in 36 characters.
- Can the string contain non-alphanumeric characters?
    - UUID standard uses hexadecimal characters.
    - This means integers 0-9 and letters 'a'-'f'.
    - Uppercase or lowercase characters can be used to define a UUID,
      however only lowercase characters should be output/returned.


**Examples / Test Cases:**

```ruby
# "f65c57f6-a6aa-17a8-faa1-a67f2dc9fa91"
generate_UUID.match? /[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}/ # => true
```

**Data Structures:**

Array.

**Algorithm:**

- initialize an array with elements 1..9 and 'a'..'f'
  - set the array to a constant variable: `HEXADECIMAL`
**random_uuid**
- initialize an empty string set to: `new_uuid`
- loop 32 times:
  - select a random character from `HEXADECIMAL`
  - push character to `new_uuid`
- insert a dash, `'-'`, at index: 8, 12, 16, and 20
- return `new_uuid`

**Code:**
```ruby
def generate_UUID
  hexadecimal = ('1'..'9').to_a + ('a'..'f').to_a
  uuid = String.new

  32.times do
    uuid << hexadecimal.sample
  end

  uuid.insert(8, '-')
  uuid.insert(12, '-')
  uuid.insert(16, '-')
  uuid.insert(20, '-')
  uuid
end

generate_UUID # => "26dc12aa-222-f37-add-89252ed4676767c"
generate_UUID # => "f7422d72-779-bb6-ecc-e9335f25c5c349a"

# Solution 2.
require 'securerandom'

def generate_UUID
  Random.uuid
end

generate_UUID # => "2adf2b30-190f-4a16-b27d-26678b5f2d69"
generate_UUID # => "2895fc87-5c32-4220-9d60-7c67ca38b35d"
```
