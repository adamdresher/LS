### Understanding the Problem
Using the multiply method, write a method that computes the square of its argument (the square is the result of multiplying a number by itself).

**Explicit Requirements:**

- Input: A number.
- Return: A number.

**Implicit requirements:**

- 

**Mental Model:**

- Create a method that squares a number argument by passing to a nested method, `multiply()`.

---
### Examples/Tests
```ruby
square(5) == 25
square(-8) == 64

# Further Exploration.
powered_by_n(3, 2) == 9
```
---
### Data Structures
None.

---
### Algorithm
**square**
- START

- READ `multiply()`
- pass it the same variable for both parameters.

- END
