### Understanding the Problem
Print all odd numbers from `1` to `99`, inclusive, to the console, with each number on a separate line.

**Explicit Requirements:**

- Input: Given integers `1` to `99`.
- Output: 99 integers on their own line.

**Implicit requirements:**

- 

**Mental Model:**

- Create a method that prints odd numbers on a new line one at a time, starting with 1 and ending with 99.

### Examples/Tests
```ruby
1
2
...
98
99
```
---
### Data Structures
None.

---
### Algorithm
Algorithm 1:
- START
- WHILE iterator <= 99
  - IF iterator is odd
  - PRINT iterator
  - iterator += 1
- END
