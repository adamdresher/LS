A NoMethodError Exception will be raised on line 43.
Library#books returns an Array of Book objects, while Book#display_data requires
a Book object.

There are two approaches to resolving this issue.  The simplest approach would
to chain #each to #books and pass #display_data to each Book object.  This
solution seems appropriate if this behavior is only required once.
If this behavior would be used repetitively, a better approach would be to
adjust the objects.  This could be done by creating a #display_books method
available for Library which displayed the display_data of each Book.  Taking
this one step further, each Book could return the display data with #to_s.  This
would eliminate the need for the method Book#display_data, replacing it with a
simple String interpolation behavior.

Given that libraries often make their catalogue of books available, it seems
reasonable to assume this #display_data behavior would be used frequently.
