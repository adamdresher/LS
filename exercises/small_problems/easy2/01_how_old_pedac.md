### Understanding the Problem
Build a program that randomly generates and prints Teddy's age. To get the age, you should generate a random number between 20 and 200.

Further Exploration:
Modify this program to ask for a name, and then print the age for that person. For an extra challenge, use "Teddy" as the name if no name is entered.

**Explicit Requirements:**

- Input: None.
- Output: A string.

**Implicit requirements:**

- 

**Mental Model:**

- Create a method that randomly generates an integer between 20 and 200, then outputs a string with that integer.

Further Exploration:
- Create a method with a parameter.  The parameter's default value is `Teddy`.  The method randomly generates an integer between 20 and 200, then outputs a string with the parameter as a name and random integer as an age.

### Examples/Tests
```ruby
# Teddy is 69 years old!
```

### Data Structures
None.

### Algorithm
Algorithm 1:
- Create a method called, `teddy`.
- Assign a variable to a randomly generated number between 20 and 200.
- Output a string with the variable.

Algorithm 2:
- Create a method called, `teddy`.
- Output a string with a method inconcatenated to generate a random number between 20 and 200.

Algorithm 3:
- Create a method called, `teddy`.
- Assign a variable to a number sampled from a range of 20 to 200.
- Output a string with the variable.

Algorithm 4 with Further Exploration:
- Create a method called, `teddy` that takes a parameter called, `name`.
- `name` has a default value of `Teddy`.
- Assign a variable to a number sampled from a range of 20 to 200.
- Output a string with the variable as the age and `name` as the name.
