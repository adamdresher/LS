## CRC Cards (Classes, Responsibilities, Collaborators)

CRC cards are used to model classes in a brainstorming phase when considering a problem.
This can be useful for mapping out the interaction of classes.

Using the Rock, Paper, Scissors program as an example, the following would be our cards:

Class:
- Player
Subclass:
- Human, Computer
Responsibilities:
- has a name
- has a move
Collaborators
- Move

Class:
- Human
Superclass:
- Player
Responsibilities:
- can choose a move
Collaborators
- Move

Class:
- Computer
Superclass:
- Player
Responsibilities:
- can choose a move
Collaborators
- Move

Class:
- Move
Responsibilities:
- has a value
- can determine if greater than
- can determine if less than
- can return a string representation

Class:
- RPSgame
Responsibilities:
- has a human player
- has a computer player
- can kick off a new game
Collaborators:
- Human
- Computer

Looking at these cards with a more graphic approach would look like the following:
