## Fake Operators
Ruby's liberal syntax, aka *'syntactical sugar'*, can cause confusion for people unfamiliar with it.  Instead of having to type out the full syntax for a method invocation, some methods are able to be called with a more legible format.

For example:
```ruby
str1.==(str2) # the more formal method syntax

str1 == str2 # the more Rubyist and legible method syntax
```

Below is a list of operators and whether they are actually methods:

`.` and `::` are operators with the highest precedence, however they are often omitted from documentation.

#### Equality methods
`==` is among one of the more popular fake operators.  Defining this one also defines its counterpart, `!=`.

#### Comparison methods
It's important to remember that defining `<` does not automatically define `>` (and vice versa).

#### The `<<` and `>>` shift methods
`<<` is another popular fake operator due to its implementation for Arrays.  As a result, this method fits nicely for custom collection methods.

#### The plus method
When considering implementation or overriding `#+`, it's wise to consider its implementation in standard classes:

- `Integer#+` - increments the value by value of the argument and returns a new Integer.
- `String#+` - concatenates with the argument and returns a new String.
- `Array#+` - concatenates with the argument and returns a new Array.
- `Date#+` - increments the date in days by the value of the argument and returns a new Date.

Looking at this, the convention is to use `#+` for incrementation or concatenation with an argument and return a new object.  Unless there's a good reason, it would be wise to follow predefined conventions.

#### Element setter and getter methods
`[]` and `[]=` are prime examples of Ruby's syntactical sugar.

For example:
```ruby
arr = %w(wubba lubba dub dub)

arr[1] # 'lubba'
arr[](1) # 'lubba'

arr[3] = 'DUB' # ['wubba', 'lubba', 'dub', 'DUB']
arr[] = (3, 'DUB') # ['wubba', 'lubba', 'dub', 'DUB']
```

These instance methods can be redefined as following:
```ruby
class Team
  def [](idx)
    members[idx]
  end

  def []=(idx, obj)
    members[id] = obj
  end
end
```
