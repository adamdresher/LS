##### Question 1
Ben and Alyssa are working on a vehicle management system.  So far, they have created classes called `Auto` and `Motorcycle` to represent automobiles and motorcycles.  After having noticed common information and calculations they were performing for each type of vehicle, they decided to break out the commonality into a separate class called `WheeledVehicle`.  This is what their code looks like so far:

```ruby
class WheeledVehicle
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading

  def initialize(tire_array, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @tires = tire_array
    @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end

  def range
    @fuel_capacity * @fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class Auto < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    super([30, 30, 32, 32], 50, 25.0)
  end
end

class Motorcycle < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    super([20, 20], 80, 8.0)
  end
end
```

Now Alan has asked them to incorporate a new type of vehicle into their system - a `Catamaran` defined as follows:

```ruby
class Catamaran
  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    # ... code omitted ...
  end
end
```

This new class does not fit well with the object hierarchy defined so far.  Catamarans don't have tires.  But we still want common code to track fuel efficiency and range.  Modify the class definitions and move code into a Module, as necessary, to share code among the `Catamaran` and the wheeled vehicles.

Answer:

Option 1:

Maintains the `WheeledVehicle` class and extrapolates the behaviors/states that aren't wheel related into a `Drivable` module.  The `Drivable` module can then be mixin to `Catamaran`.

This approach is DRY, however the relationships between classes and module seem a bit contrived.  `WheeledVehicle` and `Drivable` do not feel like natural choices.

The parameters and arguments for `WheeledVehicle#initialize` and `Catamaran#initialize` have been reordered to ensure consistency between the various `initialize` methods.

```ruby
module Drivable
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_reader :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def range
    fuel_capacity * fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class WheeledVehicle
  include Drivable

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, tire_array)
    @tires = tire_array
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Auto < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    super(50, 25.0, [30, 30, 32, 32])
  end
end

class Motorcycle < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    super(80, 8.0, [20, 20])
  end
end

class Catamaran
  include Drivable
  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, num_propellers, num_hulls)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end
end
```

Option 2:

Extrapolates all the wheel based functionality into a module to mixin to classes with wheels.  All vehicle classes can then inherit from the `Vehicle` class.

An issue that arises is that `@tires` must be initialized upon instantiation, however it should not be in the `Vehicle` class.  And the `Wheelable` module cannot mixin an `initialize` method, else it will override the implementation from `Vehicle`.

The current implementation uses a less DRY approach and initializes `@tires` in each class inheriting from `Wheelable`.  This could cause issues if `Wheelable` is changed since it's logic is not fully encapsulated.

```ruby
module Wheelable
  attr_reader :tires

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Vehicle
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_reader :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def range
    fuel_capacity * fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class Auto < Vehicle
  include Wheelable

  def initialize
    super(50, 25.0)
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    @tires = [30, 30, 32, 32]
  end
end

class Motorcycle < Vehicle
  include Wheelable

  def initialize
    super(80, 8.0)
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    @tires = [20, 20]
  end
end

class Catamaran < Vehicle
  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, num_propellers, num_hulls)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end
end
```

Option 3:

This approach feels most appropriate for the given situation.  However, it does not make use of a module as the question asked for.  The parameters and arguments for `WheeledVehicle#initialize` have been reordered to ensure consistency between the various `initialize` methods.

```ruby
class Vehicle
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_reader :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def range
    fuel_capacity * fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class WheeledVehicle < Vehicle
  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, tire_array)
    @tires = tire_array
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Auto < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    super(50, 25.0, [30, 30, 32, 32])
  end
end

class Motorcycle < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    super(80, 8.0, [20, 20])
  end
end

class Catamaran < Vehicle
  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, num_propellers, num_hulls)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end
end
```

##### Question 2
Building on the prior vehicles question, we must now also track a basic motorboat.  A motorboat has a single propeller and hull, but otherwise behaves similar to a catamaran.  Therefore, creators of `Motorboat` instances don't need to specify number of hulls or propellers.  How would you modify the vehicles code to incorporate a new `Motorboat` class?

Answer:

Option 1:

The issue with this implementation is that the arguments used for `Motorboat` don't meet the same format as `Catamaran`.  This might cause some confusion for the public interface.

```ruby
module Drivable
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_reader :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def range
    fuel_capacity * fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class WheeledVehicle
  include Drivable
  attr_accessor :tires

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, tire_array)
    @tires = tire_array
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Auto < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    super(50, 25.0, [30, 30, 32, 32])
  end
end

class Motorcycle < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    super(80, 8.0, [20, 20])
  end
end

class Boat
  include Drivable
  attr_accessor :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, num_propellers, num_hulls)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end
end

class Catamaran < Boat
end

class Motorboat < Boat
  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    # 1 propeller and 1 hull
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, 1, 1)
  end
end
```

Option 2:

The issue with this implementation is that the arguments used for `Motorboat` don't meet the same format as `Catamaran`.  This might cause some confusion for the public interface.

```ruby
module Wheelable
  attr_reader :tires

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Vehicle
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_reader :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def range
    fuel_capacity * fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class Auto < Vehicle
  include Wheelable

  def initialize
    super(50, 25.0)
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    @tires = [30, 30, 32, 32]
  end
end

class Motorcycle < Vehicle
  include Wheelable

  def initialize
    super(80, 8.0)
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    @tires = [20, 20]
  end
end

class Catamaran < Vehicle
  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end
end

class Motorboat < Catamaran
  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    super(1, 1, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end
end
```

Option 3:

This approach faces the same inherit issue as the previous 2 approaches.  To resolve this, the `initialize` methods have had their parameters reordered.  Even `WheeledVehicle` has had it's `initialize` method adjusted - to fit the convention and be more predictable.

```ruby
class Vehicle
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_reader :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def range
    fuel_capacity * fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class WheeledVehicle < Vehicle
  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, tire_array)
    @tires = tire_array
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Auto < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    super(50, 25.0, [30, 30, 32, 32])
  end
end

class Motorcycle < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    super(80, 8.0, [20, 20])
  end
end

class Catamaran < Vehicle
  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, num_propellers, num_hulls)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end
end

class Motorboat < Catamaran
  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, 1, 1)
  end
end
```

##### Question 3
The designers of the vehicle management system now want to make an adjustment for how the `range` of vehicles is calculated.  For the seaborne vehicles, due to prevailing ocean currents, they want to add an additional 10km of range even if the vehicle is out of fuel.

Alter the code related to vehicles so that the range for autos and motorcycles is still calculated as before, but for catamarans and motorboats, the range method will return an additional 10km.

Answer:

- extrapolate floatable vehicles logic into a module
  - add 10 km to range

Option 1:

```ruby
module Drivable
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_reader :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    @fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def range
    fuel_capacity * fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class WheeledVehicle
  include Drivable
  attr_accessor :tires

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, tire_array)
    @tires = tire_array
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Auto < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 4 tires are various tire pressures
    super(50, 25.0, [30, 30, 32, 32])
  end
end

class Motorcycle < WheeledVehicle
  def initialize
    # 2 tires are various tire pressures
    super(80, 8.0, [20, 20])
  end
end

class Boat
  include Drivable
  attr_accessor :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, num_propellers, num_hulls)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end

  def range
    # additional 10km of range due to prevailing ocean currents
    super + 10
  end
end

class Catamaran < Boat
end

class Motorboat < Boat
  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    # 1 propeller and 1 hull
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity, 1, 1)
  end
end
```
