## Closures in Ruby

- A closure is a general programming concept.  It's a container, or 'enclosure', used to save a 'chunk of code' that can be executed later.
  - A closure retains references to its surrounding artifacts - a closure creates *binding* to its surrounding artifacts.
- Closures are handled differently depending on the programming language- some fully support closures while others ignore them completely.
- Ruby employs closures through 3 different flavors:
  - `Proc` objects
  - `Lambda` objects
  - Blocks
