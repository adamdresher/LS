## Calling Methods with Blocks

- The `do ... end` or `{}` syntax is used to define a block.
- Blocks are passed in to methods as arguments during method invocations.
- Blocks are not a method's implementation, however they can be used by a method's implementation.
  - Blocks are sometimes referred to as un-named methods, though they are not methods.
  - Put another way, a method's return value can ignore a block, use the block to modify a return value, etc.  Determining how a block is used requires reading documentation and/or testing how the method functions.

```ruby
['Jack', 'Jayson', 'Jhon'].each do |name|
  puts name
end
```

- `do |name| ; puts name ; end` is passed as an argument to `#each`.
- The block is evaluated, but its return value is not used by the `#each` method.
