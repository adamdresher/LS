## Symbol to Proc

Ruby has syntactical sugar for methods that iterate.

- Instead of defining a block, the method can pass an expression to represent a block.
  - The `&` character followed by a symbol representation of a method available to the caller's elements.
  - This only works for blocks defined with a single method.
  - The method passed cannot require arguments.


#### `Symbol#to_proc`

When `&:a_method` is passed to a method invocation, the `&` is used to reference an explicit block.  However instead of passing a block (for example a `Proc` object), the symbol `:a_method` follows `&`.

When a symbol appends `&` and is passed as an argument, an implicit `Symbol#to_proc` is invoked on the symbol.

```ruby
def a_method
  yield(2)
end

# with Ruby's syntactical sugar
my_method(&:to_s) # => 2

# without Ruby's syntactical sugar
a_proc = :to_s.to_proc
my_method(&:to_s) # => 2
```
