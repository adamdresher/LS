## Summary

- Blocks are just one way Ruby implements closures- there is also `Proc` and `Lambda`.
- Closures have access to their surrounding context/environment.
  - This is at the core of how variable scope works.
  - Blocks can only track information initialized before the blocks are defined.
  - If data is initialized before a block is defined, the block can access modifications to the data made after the the block is defined.
- Closures are useful for pushing decisions to method invocation time.
- Closures are useful for wrapping logic, where actions are required before/after.
- Closures can be invoked within a method definition by using `yield`.
  - `yield` can accept arguments- which are passed to the block.
    - Blocks and `Proc` objects have lenient arity.
      - They are flexible with the number of arguments passed.
    - Methods and `Lambda` objects have strict arity.
      - They are inflexible with the number of arguments passed.
- The use of closures enables the ability to re-implement many methods from Ruby's core library.
  - The is a useful skill for defining custom classes.
  - `Symbol#to_proc` is useful syntactical sugar available to Ruby.
  - Closures have return values.
