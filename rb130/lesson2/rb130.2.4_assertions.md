## Assertions

There are many types of assertions that can be made.

A full list of assertions: <http://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/Minitest/Assertions.html>

#### Examples

Here's a list of the more popular assertions:

`assert(test)` - Fails unless `test` is truthy.
`assert_equal(exp, act)` - Fails unless `exp == act`.
`assert_nil(obj)` - Fails unless `obj == nil`.
`assert_raises(*exp) { ...}` - Fails unless block raises one of the exceptions, `*exp`.
`assert_instance_of(cls, obj)` - Fails unless `obj` is an instance of `cls`.
`assert_includes(collection, obj)` - Fails unless `collection` includes `obj`.

These methods are rather straightforward in their naming conventions and implementations.  The way *tests* are named seems to be logical, however some examples might be useful for adhering to conventions:

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :name, :wheels

  def initialize
    @wheels = 4
  end
end
```

```ruby
def test_car_exists
  car = Car.new
  assert(car)
end

def test_car_wheels
  car = Car.new
  assert_equal(4, car.wheels)
end

def test_name_is_nil
  car = Car.new
  assert_nil(car.name)
end

def test_raise_initialize_with_arg
  assert_raises(ArgumentError) { Car.new('Mustang' }
end

def test_instance_of_car
  car = Car.new
  assert_instance_of(Car, car)
end

# assert_includes calls assert_equal in its implementation.  As a result, Minitest will output 2 assertions, one for assert_includes and one for assert_equal.
def test_includes_car
  car = Car.new
  arr = []
  arr << car
  assert_includes(arr, car)
end
```

#### Refutations

Refutations are essentially the opposite of assertions.  Instead of *assert*, they *refute*.

- Every assertion has a corresponding refutation.
  - The same methods with `assert` replaced by `refute` and opposing implementation.
  - The same arguments are passed.
- As an assertion passes if the return value is truthy, a refutation passes if the return value is falsy.
- Refutations are not commonly used.
