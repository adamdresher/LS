## SEAT Approach

When setting up tests, there is some repetitiveness that can be extrapolated in a DRY fashion.
There is typically 4 steps to writing a test:

1. **S**etup the necessary objects.
2. **E**xecute the code against the object being tested.
3. **A**ssert the results of the execution.
4. **T**eardown and clean up any lingering artifacts.

This is the SEAT approach.

Minitest enables step 1 through the use of defining the instance method, `#setup`.  This method enables extrapolating information that is regularly used.  Take the following as an example:

```ruby
require 'Minitest/autorun'

require_relative 'car'

class CarTest << Minitest::Test
  def setup
    @car = Car.new
  end

  def test_car_exists
    assert(@car)
  end

  def test_wheels
    assert_equal(4, @car.wheels)
  end

  def test_name_is_nil
    assert_nil(@car.name)
  end
end
```

The `#setup` method is invoked before any test is invoked.  As a result, instance variables can be initialized and made available to other methods (tests).


- Step 2, execute, is defining the test methods.
- Step 3, assert, is defining the assertions to compare for the tests.
- Step 4, teardown, is useful for example when database or streams have been connected and need to be closed.
