## Summary

- Rubygems provide a library of code that can be downloaded and run or used directly inside Ruby programs.  The `gem` command is used to manage Gems.
- Rubygems also provides the tools to release new Gems.  These new Gems can be packages of code used in Ruby programs or independent Ruby programs that can be run (ie, using shell commands like Bundler, Pry, etc).
- Ruby projects typically use the Rubygems format.
- Ruby version managers help manage multiple versions of Ruby on a single system.  Each Ruby version has its own set of tools, such as `gem`, `bundle`, etc commands).
- Bundler provides the tools required to describe Ruby project dependencies.  This makes it easier to distribute a program to other systems.  Bundler installs all the necessary dependencies and ensures that the project is using the correct version of each dependency (aka a Gem).
- Rake provides an easy way to manage and run repetitive tasks that a developer needs when working on a project.
- The `.gemspec` file provides information about a project.  This is required for releasing a project as Gem.
